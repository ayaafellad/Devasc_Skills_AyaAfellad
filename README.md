# Devasc Skills Tasks README

## Task 1: GitHub Skills Test

### Task Name
GitHub Skills Test

### Task Preparation
1. Created a folder named "Devasc_Skills."
2. Initialized a Git repository in the "Devasc_Skills" folder.
3. Created a GitHub repository named "Devasc_Skills_YourInitals" (replace "YourInitals" with your initials).

### Task Implementation
1. Executed `git init` to initialize a local Git repository.
2. Connected the local repository to the GitHub repository using `git remote add origin https://github.com/ayaafellad/Devasc_Skills_AyaAfellad.git`
3. Committed changes using `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
4. Pushed the changes to GitHub using `git push -u origin master`.

### Task Troubleshooting
- Initially encountered an error when trying to rename the branch to "main": "error: refname refs/heads/master not found."
  - Solution: Created and pushed changes to the "master" branch instead of "main."

### Task Verification
- Verified successful repository creation and initial commit on GitHub.
- Checked that the "master" branch is set as the default branch on GitHub.
